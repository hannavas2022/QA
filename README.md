I'm Hanna. I`m a client service manager in advertising and marketing field who decided it is time for a change! I choosen a profession that allow me constantly self-develop and enjoy what I like to do the most - think , read, use and expect as a customer. I am going to use my talent to figure out how things work and to finde bugs for keeping the product's quality high. And that's how I decided to be a QA tester.

WHY I LIKE A QA TESTING?

 ✏️ I don't like to guess what someone meant. So I always try to write my thoughts the way comes to the others easily understand.
✏️ Exploratory testing is a creativity. I always try to find not only obvious ways to use the software/site or features, but also more non-standard ones that may be related to the cultural, age, educational and other characteristics of users.
✏️ I easily catch bugs and inconsistencieses. Testing is an endless opportunity to find what to change for better and easier usage.
