Hi, I'm a Software QA Engineer with a background in marketing and frontend development. I began my QA journey at the end of 2022, focusing primarily on manual testing, and have developed a strong passion for API testing. Since mid-2024, I've been expanding my skill set into automation testing. I'm always looking to learn and improve in this ever-evolving field!
